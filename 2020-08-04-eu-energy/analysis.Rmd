```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Libraries:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Import data
```{r}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-08-04')
energy_types <- tuesdata$energy_types
energy_totals <- tuesdata$country_totals
```

OK so based on a quick glance, possible options could be: 
- reproducing the example chart from the TT post
- a slope diagram showing change by year

```{r}
totals <- energy_types %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(calc_total = sum(`2018`))
```
OK so just summing all of them does in fact equal total net production in the energy_totals df.

Get the data ready for the marimekko chart:
```{r}
#
```
