# 2021-05-25 Tidy Tuesday: Mario Kart
```{r}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load("2021-05-25")
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
proj_path <- "2021-05-25-mariokart"
records <- tuesdata$records
drivers <- tuesdata$drivers 
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


What do the record durations look like? 

How do the record durations compare between level? In other words, how fast did people get better at each level? 

## Maybe do a time series of all the scores, with branching lines for with and without shortcuts? 
```{r}
records %>%
  filter(track == "Luigi Raceway" & type == "Three Lap") %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, time, color = shortcut))+
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
records %>%
  filter(type == "Three Lap") %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, time, color = shortcut))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~track)
```

```{r}
records %>%
  filter(type == "Single Lap") %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, time, color = shortcut))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~track)
```
Why does it seem to be either or on this? 
```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
```

```{r}
first_records <- records%>%
  filter(type == "Three Lap") %>%
  group_by(track) %>%
  filter(row_number()==1) %>%
  mutate(first_time = time) %>%
  select(track, first_time)

records %>%
  inner_join(first_records, by="track") %>%
  filter(type == "Three Lap") %>%
  mutate(adjusted_time = time - first_time) %>%
  filter(track %in% c("Toad's Turnpike","Choco Mountain")) %>%
  ggplot( aes(date, adjusted_time, color = track, group = interaction(track, shortcut))) +
   geom_point()+
   geom_line()#+
   #scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Paired")


# To Do: 
#Get the top, maybe three tracks, color those and label them. 
# Keep the rest of the lines grey 
```

Test.

## How many records do these people have?
